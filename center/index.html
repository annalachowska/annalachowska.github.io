<h1> The Center of the Small Quantum Group </h1>
<h2> Ongoing research project </h2>

<br> <br>

The small quantum group is a finite dimensional subquotient of the restricted quantized universal enveloping algebra, associated with a given root system and a primitive root of unity. It was defined by <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~gyuri/">George Lusztig</a> in the early 90s as an analog of the restricted enveloping algebra in prime characteristic <a href="Lusztig_JAMS.pdf">(see here for the simply-laced case).</a>   

<p> 
 The first explicit computation of the center was done in 1995 <a href="Kerler_sl2.pdf">in case of <i> sl(2) </i></a> by Thomas Kerler. In 1999, K.Brown and I.Gordon <a href="BrGor.pdf">identified</a> a natural subalgebra in the regular block of the center, isomorphic to the algebra of coinvariants of the given root system.

Here are some of my publications on the topic:  <br>  <br>
(1)<a href="0107098.pdf">On the Center of the Small Quantum Group</a> - describes the largest known subalgebra in the center, the "twice-coinvariant algebra" <br>
(2)<a href="0107136.pdf">The Small Quantum Group and the Verlinde Algebra</a><br>
(3)<a href="0609819.pdf">The Small Quantum Group and the Springer Resolution</a>
(together with <a href="http://math.mit.edu/people/profile.php?pid=22">Roman Bezrukavnikov</a>).- describes the center of the regular block of the small quantum group in terms of sheaf cohomologies over the Springer resolution. The "twice-coinvariant algebra" shows up nicely in this setting. However, the combinatorics of the whole center is not yet understood beyond the <i>sl(2)</i> case.  <br>
<br> 
Currently we are working with <a href="http://www.math.umb.edu/~jackson/">Steve Jackson</a> on a computation of the center of the small quantum <i>sl(3)</i>. According to the preliminary results, the center of a small quantum group of rank higher than 1 is much bigger than the "twice-coinvariant" subalgebra 
found in <a href="0107098.pdf">(1)</a>. Still, we expect the answer to have a clear combinatorial description in terms of the given root system.

<h2> Hochschild cohomologies in the case sl(2) </h2>
<br> 

Based on the geometric interpretation of the Hochshild cohomologies of the 
small quantum group, obtained in <a href="0609819.pdf">(3)</a>, together with Azat Gainutdinov we are studying  
the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on <i> HH(u) </i> in the case of the small quantum <i> sl(2) </i>. The result is likely to have implications for the W- algebra that is the symmetry of the <i> (1,p)</i> logarithmic conformal field theory (see 
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/math/0512621v2.pdf">paper)<a/>
