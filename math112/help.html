<TR><TD>Coaching is a new support system for the students that will run this semester. It is designed especially for those in the class who need help the most. The participants of the coaching program will be assigned to a group of five or six, and each group will meet with a coach once a week for an hour. Sessions will be interactive, designed to help the students understand concepts currently taught in the course, and improve their problem solving skills. Coaching groups will be formed after the first midterm. If you are invited and accept the invitation, attendance becomes mandatory. If you miss more than one meeting without a very good excuse, your spot will be given to someone else. If you did not get invited, you can still apply - we will try to accommodate you depending on the availability of spots in the program. Schedules of group meetings will be coordinated by the coaches. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>A limited number of individual tutoring slots by the coach will be available at the beginning of the semester before the regular coaching sessions begin. </TD></TR>   
<!-- <TR><TD><B>Problem sessions</B> MTuW 7-9pm, 205 LOM.  Run by 
Efim Abrikosov.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Evening problem sessions are open to all students of Math112. The purpose of the sessions is to provide an opportunity for the students to go over more examples than can be covered in class, discuss last week's homework, and ask any questions they might have on the material. The evening problem sessions will be held three evenings per week.</TD></TR> -->   
<TR><TD><B>Instructor office hours:</B> 
Your instructor will hold weekly office hours. The information on the time and place should be available on your section webpage in classes*v2. 
<TR><TD><B>QR tutors and Math and Science tutors:</B>
The specialities and hours of 
availability for the math-science tutors and quantitative reasoning tutors can be checked at 
<A HREF="http://yalecollege.yale.edu/content/tutoring-and-academic-support">

<TR><TD><B>Peer tutors:</B> 


</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Peer tutors are associated with Math112 only. They are very familiar with the course 
and the only students who come to their office hours are Math112 students, so the topics discussed 
are likely to be relevant to everyone. They can go over troublesome topics with you, and give homework hints. 
In addition, both peer tutors are available for individual appointments by request. You can email them for an appointment, just for yourself, or go in with a small group of friends. </TD></TR>
