<TR><TD>To help build your problem-solving skills, and to introduce you to software important for 
many scientific applications, we shall make some use of Mathematica in this course.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>With the aid of occasional in-class demonstrations, you will learn to 
use several simple commands with which you can explore an unlimited collection of examples.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>In addition, you can use several more complicated pieces of Mathematica code, available on the 
course website, to build intuition about some of the more subtle issues of the course.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Mathematica is installed in all of the AM&T clusters.  A list is available at
<A HREF="http://www.yale.edu/acs/cluster/">http://www.yale.edu/acs/cluster/</A>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A HREF="../112Mma/index.html">Here</A> is a description of our use of Mathmatica, along with 
some sample and practice problems, and several small programs we shall use.</TD></TR>
